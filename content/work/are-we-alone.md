## A Sky Full of Stars

Coldplay’s Sky full of Stars is one of my all time favourites. Astronomy is something that always fascinated me. If you’re into stars, aliens and whatever outerspace, hit me up.

We could have a really long conversation about black holes, stars, universe, worm holes, speed of light, deep sky objects, astro-photogaphy and so on.
